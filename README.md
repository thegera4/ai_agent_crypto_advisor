AI agent made with Google ADK framework, python and deepseek api.

It uses tools that connect to CoinGecko API (https://docs.coingecko.com/reference/introduction) to get real cryptocurrencies data in order make analysis and provide an investment strategy absed on user input.

It can only get data for ethereum, pepe, popcat, bitcoin, shiba-inu and neiro (I invest in those coins and I wanted to focus only in those), but you can change the code to include as many coins as you want (if they are available in Coin Gecko API).

Example of questions asked and provided investment strategy (in spanish):
